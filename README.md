# CMPUT291_A3

The program is a basic ride-sharing program that allows users to provide rides to other users and uses a database for most of its important functionality.

The program requires at least JRE 1.7 to be installed as well as SQLite3. To run the program use the command “java Main.jar [arg]” where “arg” is the path to the database file. If no argument is provided the program will default to the local directory and use tables.db.
